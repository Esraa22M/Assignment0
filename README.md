# Programming-Assignment classical ciphers (https://github.com/Esraa22M/Assignment0/tree/master/Assignment01)[Assignment01[
## Project overview
* The  (https://github.com/Esraa22M/Assignment0/blob/master/Assignment01/ciphers.py)[ciphers.py] support encryption and decryption using shift, affine, and vigenere ciphers.
* The (https://github.com/Esraa22M/Assignment0/blob/master/Assignment01/ciphers.py)[ciphers.py] callable from command line as follows:
   * First argument is the cipher name  [“shift”,”affine”,”vigenere”].
   * Second argument is the operation type [“enc”, “dec”].
   * The Third argument is the input file.
   * The fourth argument is the output file.
   *  The last argument is the the list of encryption keys required for the cipher.
